### Architectural Patterns

#### 1. **Feature-Based Architecture**
- Organization by functionality instead of file types
- Each feature contains its own components, hooks, and types
- Clear separation of responsibilities

#### 2. **Custom Hooks Pattern**
- Business logic encapsulated in custom hooks
- Logic reuse between components
- Separation of concerns between UI and logic

#### 3. **Component Composition**
- Small and reusable components
- Minimized props drilling
- Use of React Context when necessary

#### 4. **Data Fetching with React Query**
- Centralized server state management
- Automatic caching and revalidation
- Loading and error state handling

## üîß Technical Decisions Made

### 1. **Technology Stack**

**Frontend Framework: React 19 + TypeScript**
- React 19 for latest performance optimizations
- TypeScript for type safety and better DX
- Vite as bundler for its speed and simple configuration

**Styling: Tailwind CSS v4**
- Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- Optimized configuration with path aliases
- Consistent design system

**UI Components: Radix UI + Custom Components**
- Radix UI for accessible base components
- Custom components for specific cases
- Variant system with class-variance-authority

### 2. **State Management**

**React Query (TanStack Query)**
- Server state management
- Automatic caching with 1-minute staleTime
- Automatic revalidation every minute
- Client-side data transformation to avoid multiple requests

**Local State with React Hooks**
- useState for simple component state
- useMemo for performance optimizations
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### 3. **Data Handling**

**API Integration**
- Single endpoint with client-side transformation
- Frontend filtering to avoid multiple requests
- CORS proxy (allorigins.win) for development
- Client-side data formatting (dates, amounts)

**Date Handling**
- Luxon for date manipulation
- Consistent formatting for Argentina (es-AR)
- Timezone handling and validations

### 4. **Testing Strategy**

**Playwright for E2E Testing**
- Automated visual regression tests
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Responsive testing on different viewports
- Snapshots for visual comparison

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**

**Code Splitting**
- Vite for automatic optimizations

**Memoization**
- useMemo for expensive calculations

## üöÄ Future Improvements
